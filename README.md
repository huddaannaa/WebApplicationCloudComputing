# MULTI-SCALABLE-CLOUD-APPLICATION-VALUE-AT-RISK-VAR-
## This contains Front and Backend code for AWS LAMBDA. One can contact me for EC2's front and backend source because i will need to reconstruct and make amends to the source. This is because it entails a user to login with credentions for AWS, Keypairs and other security access keys source-code for the project (Scalable multi-Cloud application, that computes Value at Risk for some well-known companies listed on stock markets

#### Value At Risk (VAR): VAR is the calculation of risk of an investment. Resultant computations show how a given investment will climb or fall over some time span, with some given market conditions. Due to VAR’s computational expense, power, time and use of large random values for computations, we incorporate a multi cloud architecture together with scalable services. Using the three VAR methods namely, historical, covariance and Monte Carlo. The proposed system is made up of public cloud providers, Amazon and Google, rendering services such as Amazon Web Services and Google app engine. The respective companies offer On-demand self-service, broad network access, rapid elasticity, measured service and resource pooling in accordance to NIST. The Google app engine (GAE) is a public cloud service managed by google. It falls into the Platform as a service category (PaaS) and supports a variety of programming languages like python, we will run a source code at the frontend that  will take specific inputs and display output in a required manner to the a given consumer. AWS lambda is also a cloud computing service which lets consumers run code or scripts to accomplish certain tasks or functions and is categorized as a PaaS (Platform as a service) Just like GAE.

#### 1) Historical: This is calculated by finding the return series, using the adjacent close of a given company. The next step is to sort the values from largest profit to the largest loss, taking the total number of data points we calculate the 95 and 99 percentages to attain the VAR at 95 and 95 percentages 

#### 2) Covariance: We compute the mean and standard deviation (stdev) to fit   the give formula with a set investment, where D is 1.65 at 95 and 2.33 at 99: −(𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 +(𝐷) ∗𝜎))∗𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 
 
#### 3) Monte Carlo: Having the mean and stdev from the previous step, we use the python function “random. Gauss” to generate random number (q).  ‘q’ is then used together with the most recent price of the adjacent close from a given company (p) to fit the formula: 𝑛 = (1 +𝑞)∗𝑝 The resultant n produces a new price list, which is run through the historical step to attain VAR at 95 and 99 percentages.
